# Google - Developing Containerized Applications on Google Cloud

These are the notes for myself taken from the specialization ["Developing Containerized Applications on Google Cloud.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developing-containerized-applications-on-google-cloud) I have switched from using One Note for any of my note taking to Juypyter notebooks, hosted on Google Colab, mainly because I realized it was a better format for taking technical notes. I could use code block examples and automatically run turning the notes into a better form of active rather than passive learning. I've also found that it is much easier doing the formatting I want using Markdown than the autoformating that Microsoft Office products use, which continues to be a mystery to me. Because most of the code was given in the form of handouts, I mainly do not have code on the notebooks themselves, except for clarification of something that cannot run on Jupyter anyway.

My thoughts for this class are generally positive. There is not much of an interactive element, as the classes mainly consist of slide deck presentations that were definitely built from Markdown files. There were two labs, one on creating and running a docker containers on Google Cloud Platform, and one on Deploying a Containerized Application on Google Cloud Run.

In these notes, I tried to draw from my own personal and professional experiences to relate to the subject.

The specialization is estimated to take about 5 hours to learn.

I have made some personal anotations for myself through the comments feature of Google Colab, which I do not believe will transfer through into Github. Others are welcome to use these notes as they see fit. None of the code pieces will actually run, since they are generally various yaml and other types of configuration files that I've copied the contents of as examples.
